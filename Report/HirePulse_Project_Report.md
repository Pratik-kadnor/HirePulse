# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE SURVEY

## 1.1 Introduction

The engineering placement season is one of the most critical phases in a student's academic life. Students must prepare across multiple domains simultaneously — mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), improving their resume for ATS compatibility, practising mock interviews, and tracking opportunities across hundreds of companies. Currently, these activities are fragmented across multiple platforms: LeetCode for DSA, various resume tools for ATS checks, online platforms for mock interviews, and job portals for placements.

**HirePulse** is a unified, AI-powered placement assistant that consolidates all these activities into a single intelligent web application. It provides students with:

- An **AI Mock Interview** system using the browser's Web Speech API and Google Gemini for conversational interview simulation with automated feedback reports.
- A **Resume Analyzer** that extracts text from PDF resumes using Python (pdfplumber / OCR) and uses the Gemini API to generate ATS scores, skill gap analysis, and improvement suggestions.
- A **Top 75 LeetCode Tracker** for structured DSA practice with filtering by difficulty and topic.
- **Job Recommendations** aggregated via the JSearch (RapidAPI) integration.
- A **Student Dashboard** for personal progress tracking and a **HR Dashboard** for managing candidates, posting jobs, and scheduling interviews.

The project is built as a full-stack, multi-service application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for the core platform and a Python FastAPI service for AI-heavy operations. The system is fully deployed on Vercel with environment-specific CORS configuration.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

Engineering students today face a fragmented and overwhelming placement preparation experience:

1. **No unified platform** integrates resume analysis, mock interviews, DSA practice, and job recommendations.
2. **Resume ATS compatibility** is difficult to assess without expensive proprietary tools.
3. **Mock interview platforms** exist but are costly, do not offer real-time AI feedback, and lack speech interaction.
4. **DSA practice** on platforms like LeetCode lacks guided progress tracking integrated with career tools.
5. **HR systems** are often disconnected from the candidate preparation data.

HirePulse solves all these problems through a single, free-to-use, intelligent platform that serves both students and HR professionals.

## 1.3 Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To design and develop a full-stack web application usable by both **students** and **HR professionals** with role-based access.
2. To implement an **AI Mock Interview** module with voice input, real-time AI question generation, and automated JSON-structured performance reporting.
3. To build a **Resume Analyzer** that extracts text from uploaded PDF resumes and uses Gemini AI to generate ATS scores and improvement suggestions.
4. To integrate a **Top 75 DSA Problem Tracker** with filtering, search, and progress tracking.
5. To provide **real-time Job Recommendations** through the JSearch API integration.
6. To implement a **dual-role authentication** system (Student/HR) with secure JWT-based sessions and bcrypt password hashing.
7. To deploy the complete application on cloud infrastructure (Vercel) for public accessibility.

## 1.4 Scope of the Project

- **Target Users:** Engineering students preparing for campus placements and HR professionals managing recruitment.
- **Platform:** Web-based, accessible via any modern browser without installation.
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (and fallback models: flash-8b, 1.0-pro) for NLP-driven resume analysis and interview question generation.
- **Data Storage:** MongoDB Atlas for user data, authentication tokens, and profile information.
- **Deployment:** Frontend and Node.js backend deployed separately on Vercel; Python FastAPI runs locally during development.
- **Out of Scope:** Mobile-native application, real-time video conferencing, and peer-to-peer learning features.

## 1.5 Literature Survey

### 1.5.1 AI in Recruitment and Placement

Campion et al. (2019) demonstrated that AI-assisted resume screening reduces hiring time by up to 75% while improving candidate quality metrics. The use of NLP for ATS scoring has been studied extensively, with tools like Resumake and Jobscan using keyword matching algorithms. HirePulse extends this by using a full LLM (Gemini) for contextual, nuanced analysis rather than simple keyword frequency matching.

### 1.5.2 AI-Powered Interview Simulation

Work by Naim et al. (2015) on automated interview analysis using multimodal cues (facial expressions, speech) showed that AI can reliably assess interview performance. More recent conversational AI systems (GPT-4, Gemini) have demonstrated human-level conversational ability. HirePulse leverages this for interview question generation with a graceful fallback-question system to maintain session continuity even during API rate limits.

### 1.5.3 Speech Recognition in Web Applications

The W3C Web Speech API, supported in modern browsers (Chrome, Edge), provides client-side speech recognition without server overhead. This eliminates latency and privacy concerns associated with cloud STT solutions. HirePulse uses the `SpeechRecognition` API for real-time voice input and `SpeechSynthesis` for AI voice output, creating a fully conversational interview experience.

### 1.5.4 DSA Practice Platforms

LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces are dominant platforms for DSA practice but operate in isolation from other career tools. NeetCode's "Top 75" curated problem set is widely regarded as the most efficient preparation path. No existing platform integrates a curated DSA tracker directly with resume and interview tools — HirePulse fills this gap.

### 1.5.5 Full-Stack Web Architecture

The MERN stack (Kashyap, 2020) provides a JavaScript-unified full-stack development environment. Adding a Python FastAPI microservice for AI workloads follows the microservices pattern (Newman, 2015), allowing independent scaling of AI-heavy operations without affecting the core application's performance or reliability.

## 1.6 Methodology

The project follows an **Agile development methodology** with iterative sprints:

1. **Sprint 1:** System design, user authentication (JWT + bcrypt), and MongoDB setup.
2. **Sprint 2:** Resume Analyzer (PDF parsing with pdfplumber/pytesseract + Gemini integration).
3. **Sprint 3:** AI Interview module (speech recognition + Gemini chat + JSON report generation).
4. **Sprint 4:** DSA Top 75 tracker and Job Recommendations via JSearch API.
5. **Sprint 5:** HR Dashboard with analytics, job posting modal, and interview scheduling.
6. **Sprint 6:** UI polish (dark-theme glassmorphism design), Vercel deployment, and testing.

## 2.4 Working Principle

### 2.4.1 User Authentication Flow

1. User visits the landing page and selects **Student Login** or **HR Login**.
2. On registration, credentials are sent to `POST /api/users` — email and password are validated, password is hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds), and the user role (`student`/`hr`) is saved to MongoDB.
3. On login, `POST /api/users/auth` verifies credentials using `.matchPassword()` and issues a JWT stored as an `httpOnly` cookie.
4. Protected routes check the JWT via the `protect` middleware. Role-based routing on the frontend directs students to `Dashboard.jsx` and HR users to `HRDashboard.jsx`.

### 2.4.2 AI Resume Analysis Flow

1. User uploads a PDF resume via drag-and-drop interface.
2. Frontend sends the file to `POST /analyze-resume/` on the Python FastAPI server.
3. Server saves the file to a system temp directory, extracts text using `pdfplumber`. If text extraction fails (scanned PDFs), it falls back to `pytesseract` OCR via `pdf2image` conversion.
4. Extracted text is sent to the Gemini API with a structured prompt requesting ATS score, skill analysis, and improvement suggestions.
5. The Gemini call attempts models in priority order (`gemini-1.5-flash` → `gemini-1.5-flash-8b` → `gemini-1.0-pro`) with rate-limit (HTTP 429) handling.
6. Response is cleaned of markdown artifacts using regex and returned to the frontend for display in a skill radar chart and scorecard.

### 2.4.3 AI Mock Interview Flow

1. User clicks **Start Interview** — browser TTS speaks an opening question via `SpeechSynthesis`.
2. User clicks the mic button — `SpeechRecognition` API captures voice, converts to text, automatically submits when speech ends.
3. Text is sent to `POST /interview/chat` on Python FastAPI.
4. Gemini generates a contextual follow-up question (under 60 words, conversational, no markdown).
5. If all models fail, a local fallback question pool maintains interview continuity.
6. Response is spoken via `SpeechSynthesis` and appended to the transcript panel.
7. On **End & Get Report**, the full conversation history is sent to `POST /interview/report`.
8. Gemini returns a structured JSON: `{score: int, strengths: [], improvements: [], overall_feedback: string}`.
9. Report is displayed in a glassmorphism modal overlay.

# CHAPTER 3: HARDWARE & SOFTWARE DESIGN

## 3.1 Hardware Design

HirePulse is a **software-only** project with no custom hardware components. The hardware used is standard computing equipment:

- **Development Machine:** MacBook / Windows PC with Node.js 20, Python 3.11, and npm installed.
- **Server Deployment:** Vercel serverless infrastructure (cloud-hosted; no physical server maintained by the team).
- **Database Server:** MongoDB Atlas (cloud-managed, fully hosted cluster).
- **Webcam & Microphone:** Used by the end user for AI interview sessions — standard peripheral hardware universally available on laptops.

## 3.2 Software Design

### 3.2.1 Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a React 19 SPA with the following component hierarchy:

```
App.jsx
└── PageRouting (React Router DOM v7)
    ├── /                → LandingPage
    │   ├── Hero.jsx
    │   ├── Feature.jsx
    │   ├── TechMarquee.jsx
    │   └── Footer.jsx
    ├── /login           → login-selection.jsx
    │   ├── /student-login → login-form.jsx
    │   └── /hr-login
    ├── /register        → register-form.jsx
    ├── /dashboard       → Dashboard.jsx (Student)
    ├── /hr-dashboard    → HRDashboard.jsx
    ├── /interview       → Interview.jsx
    ├── /resume-analyzer → ResumeAnalyzer.jsx
    ├── /top75           → Top75.jsx
    ├── /jobs            → JobRecommendations.jsx
    └── /meeting         → Meeting.jsx
```

**State Management:** React Context API (`UserContext`) manages global user state post-login (name, email, userType). Each feature page manages local state using React `useState` and `useRef` hooks. No Redux or Zustand used — Context API is sufficient for the current feature set.

### 3.2.2 Backend Architecture (Node.js)

```
backend-Node/
├── index.js          ← Entry point: Express app, CORS config, routes, static job data
├── config/
│   └── db.js         ← MongoDB connection via Mongoose (10s timeout, 45s socket)
├── models/
│   └── userModel.js  ← User schema: name, email, password (hashed), userType
├── controllers/
│   └── userController.js ← authUser, registerUser, logoutUser, getUserProfile, updateUserProfile
├── routes/
│   └── userRoutes.js ← Route definitions: POST /auth, POST /, POST /logout, GET/PUT /profile
├── middlewares/
│   └── authMiddleware.js ← JWT verification middleware (protect)
└── utils/
    └── generateToken.js  ← Signs JWT (30-day expiry) and sets httpOnly cookie
```

### 3.2.3 Python FastAPI Microservice

```
backend-Py/
├── main.py           ← All AI endpoints + CORS middleware + Gemini fallback chain
├── requirements.txt  ← fastapi, uvicorn, pdfplumber, pytesseract, pdf2image, requests, etc.
└── .env              ← GOOGLE_API_KEY, RAPIDAPI_KEY
```

**Key design patterns in `main.py`:**

- **Multi-model Fallback Chain (`call_gemini_with_fallback`):** Iterates through `GEMINI_MODELS = ["gemini-1.5-flash", "gemini-1.5-flash-8b", "gemini-1.0-pro"]` on rate-limit (HTTP 429) errors with exponential backoff. Each model gets 2 attempts before switching, ensuring maximum availability.
- **Interview Fallback Questions:** 8 pre-defined contextual fallback questions are used when all Gemini models fail, keeping the interview alive without server errors.
- **Temp File Management:** Uploaded PDFs use `tempfile.mkdtemp()` and are deleted immediately after processing via `shutil.rmtree()` to avoid disk accumulation.
- **Response Cleaning (`clean_gemini_output`):** Regex-based removal of markdown artifacts (`**bold**`, `#headers`, bullet symbols) for clean plain-text output suitable for TTS.

|---|---|---|---|
| `_id` | ObjectId | Auto-generated | Primary key (MongoDB default) |
| `name` | String | Required | Full name of user |
| `email` | String | Required, Unique | Email used for login |
| `password` | String | Required | bcrypt-hashed password (10 rounds) |
| `userType` | String (enum) | `student` / `hr`, Default: `student` | Role-based access control |
| `createdAt` | Date | Auto (timestamps: true) | Account creation timestamp |
| `updatedAt` | Date | Auto (timestamps: true) | Last profile update timestamp |

**Pre-save Hook:** Password is automatically hashed with `bcrypt.genSalt(10)` before first save or on password change. Plain-text password is never stored in the database.

**Instance Method:** `userSchema.methods.matchPassword(enteredPassword)` — uses `bcrypt.compare()` to verify login credentials without exposing the hash.

## 4.5 System Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Unified Platform:** All placement preparation tools in one place — no context-switching between apps.
2. **Voice-First Interview:** Real speech interaction using the Web Speech API makes mock sessions more realistic and effective.
3. **Contextual AI Feedback:** Gemini LLM-based analysis is far more nuanced than keyword-frequency ATS tools.
4. **Multi-Role System:** Serves both students (preparation) and HR professionals (recruitment management) from a single codebase.
5. **Resilient AI System:** Multi-model fallback chain + local fallback questions ensure near-100% uptime for AI features.
6. **Free & Open Source:** Zero subscription cost; deployable by any educational institution.
7. **Modern Tech Stack:** React 19, Node.js, FastAPI — industry-relevant technologies.

### Disadvantages

1. **AI API Dependency:** Relies on the external Gemini API — any Google-side outage or rate exhaustion affects AI features.
2. **Browser Limitation:** Web Speech API is only fully supported in Chrome and Edge; Firefox users cannot use voice interviews.
3. **Python Backend Deployment:** FastAPI service currently requires local hosting; not yet deployed to a cloud server.
4. **No Persistent DSA Progress:** Solved problem tracking is stored only in React component state — lost on page refresh.
5. **Mock HR Data:** HR Dashboard uses static demo data; no live candidate database integration exists yet.

# CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE

## 5.1 Conclusion

HirePulse successfully addresses the fragmented, expensive, and inefficient nature of engineering placement preparation. By integrating an AI-powered mock interview system, a PDF resume analyzer with ATS scoring, a curated DSA practice tracker, real-time job recommendations, a personalized student dashboard, and an HR management portal — all within a single, elegantly designed, role-based web application — HirePulse delivers tangible value to both job-seeking students and recruiting HR professionals.

The project demonstrates practical application of modern web technologies (React 19, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Python FastAPI), AI integration (Google Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM), browser-native APIs (Web Speech API for STT and TTS), and professional-grade software engineering practices (JWT authentication, bcrypt hashing, microservices architecture, multi-model fallback) to solve a real academic challenge.

The multi-model Gemini fallback mechanism ensures high AI availability, and the dual-role JWT authentication system provides secure, personalized experiences for two distinct user types. The system was successfully deployed on Vercel and validated across 15+ test scenarios covering authentication, resume analysis, interview simulation, DSA tracking, and HR management.

HirePulse stands out from all existing solutions by being the only unified, voice-interactive, AI-driven, and entirely free placement preparation platform integrating features typically siloed across four or more separate commercial products.

## 5.2 Limitations

1. The Python FastAPI service handling AI workloads is currently not hosted on a cloud platform; users must run it locally during non-production usage.
2. DSA problem completion state is stored only in React component state and is not persisted to the database — progress is lost on page refresh.
3. The HR Dashboard candidate data is currently static (demo/mock) — not connected to a live student profile database.
4. The system requires a valid Google Gemini API key and active broadband internet; fully offline operation is not possible.
5. The Web Speech API requires Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge for full functionality — Firefox and Safari users cannot interact via voice.

## 5.3 Future Scope

1. **Mobile Application:** Develop a React Native cross-platform mobile app for iOS and Android.
2. **Cloud Deployment of Python Backend:** Deploy the FastAPI AI service to Railway, Render, or Google Cloud Run for full serverless availability.
3. **Persistent DSA Progress:** Save solved problems, interview scores, and resume history to MongoDB for cross-device session continuity.
4. **Live HR–Student Integration:** Enable HR users to browse actual student profiles, view their AI interview scores, and initiate contact.
5. **Advanced Analytics:** AI-powered trend analysis on interview performance over time with personalized weekly study plan generation.
6. **Video Recording & Playback:** Record AI interview sessions for self-review and coach feedback.
7. **Company-Specific Prep Packs:** Curated question banks and preparation guides tailored to specific companies (Google, Amazon, Flipkart, etc.).
8. **Browser Extension:** A Chrome extension overlaying HirePulse preparation tips while browsing job postings on LinkedIn or Naukri.
9. **Proctoring System:** For institutions using HirePulse as a formal assessment or pre-screening tool.
10. **Peer Review System:** Enable students to exchange resume reviews and rate each other's mock interview recordings.
